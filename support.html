<h1>Clef Converter - Support</h1>

<details>
  <summary>Why did a page come out all black?</summary>
  <p>This can happen if the staff lines are undetected. Most commonly, it's because the staff lines were tilted instead of being completely horizontal.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Why did a page look unchanged?</summary>
  <p>This is because the algorithm failed to locate the clefs that you didn't specify for. Most likely a treble clef that was skinnier than the templates I prepared the algorithm for will go undetected! (Certtainly happends with bass clefs as well, espcially small inline clefs) I am working on it :)</p>
