For help with Clef Converter, I made you a short Q&A!

Why did a page come out all black?

  This can happen if the staff lines are undetected. Most commonly, it's because the staff lines were tilted instead of being completely horizontal.

Why did a page look unchanged?

  This is because the algorithm failed to locate the clefs that you didn't specify for. Most likely a treble clef that was skinnier than the templates I prepared the algorithm for will go undetected! (Certtainly happends with bass clefs as well, espcially small inline clefs) I am working on it :)
